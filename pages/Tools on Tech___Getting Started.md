- My template includes a variety of quick start pages that you can use to get started quickly on a specific task or project. Whether you're planning a new project, taking notes on a book, or tracking your habits, you'll find pages designed to help you jumpstart your work.
- To help you get started, I recommend taking a quick tour of the template. I've created a page called " [[Tools on Tech/Quick Tour]] " that will walk you through the various sections of the template and explain what each one is for. But feel free to explore the template on your own too - you might find some pages that suit your needs right away.
